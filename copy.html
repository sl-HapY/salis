        <h4> Statement Regarding the Use of OpenAI's GPT-4 in Model Development </h4>

        I hereby formally declare that, in the process of developing Salis and Sur model, I have adhered to all applicable terms
        of service, licensing agreements, and ethical guidelines set forth by OpenAI. Specifically, I have utilized OpenAI's
        GPT-4 series as a foundational reference and tool to enhance the capabilities of my model. This utilization has been
        conducted strictly within the bounds of OpenAI's usage policies, ensuring compliance with their intellectual property
        rights and restrictions.

        It is important to clarify that my work does not involve any unauthorized replication, redistribution, or commercial
        exploitation of OpenAI's proprietary models, code, or datasets. Instead, my efforts have focused on leveraging the
        general knowledge, insights, and methodologies inspired by GPT-4 to create a distinct and independent solution tailored
        to my specific use case. Any data or outputs generated during this process have been produced in accordance with
        OpenAI's guidelines, ensuring that no sensitive or restricted information has been misused or improperly handled.

        Furthermore, I have taken deliberate steps to ensure that my model operates independently of OpenAI's infrastructure and
        does not rely on their proprietary systems for ongoing functionality. The development process has included extensive
        fine-tuning, testing, and validation to ensure that the resulting model is unique and does not infringe upon OpenAI's
        intellectual property or violate any of their stipulated terms.

        I am deeply committed to upholding the highest standards of ethical conduct and transparency in the field of artificial
        intelligence. My intention has always been to contribute positively to the advancement of AI technologies while
        respecting the rights and contributions of organizations such as OpenAI. Should there be any concerns or questions
        regarding the nature of my work, I am fully prepared to provide additional clarification or documentation to demonstrate
        compliance with all relevant policies and regulations.

        In conclusion, I respectfully assert that my use of OpenAI's GPT-4 has been entirely lawful, ethical, and respectful of
        their intellectual property. I remain dedicated to fostering innovation in the AI community while ensuring that the
        rights and contributions of all stakeholders are duly acknowledged and protected.

        Sincerely,
        salist™
